# Error Handling

### Frontend:

Login / Signup Errors: Errors during login or signup (e.g., incorrect credentials) are displayed to the user in the form of alert messages or error fields.
API Errors: When the frontend cannot fetch data from the backend (e.g., due to network issues or bad requests), it will show appropriate error messages.
Validation Errors: Form inputs such as username, email, password, etc., are validated before submission. If invalid, a message will appear prompting the user to correct the input.

### Backend:

400 (Bad Request): Returned if the client sends an invalid request (e.g., missing required fields).
401 (Unauthorized): Returned if the user is not authenticated or the JWT token is invalid.
404 (Not Found): Returned if the requested route or resource doesn't exist.
500 (Internal Server Error): Any server-side issues will be caught and logged, and a generic error response will be sent.
Backend routes are protected with JWT-based authentication to ensure secure access.
